The global average total cost of a data breach is **USD 4.35 million**, the highest it has ever been. 
Cybercrime is predicted to **cost the world USD $8 trillion** in 2023. If it were measured as a country, then cybercrime would be the world’s third largest economy after the U.S. and China. 

Cybersecurity is the practice of protecting and recovering data, networks, devices, and programs from threats. Those threats can have *digital*, *human*, or *physical* components. 

Cybersecurity can have one or more of the following three components: digital, human, or physical.

**Digital security** involves safeguarding your data and systems from digital threats. These threats range from malware attacks, such as viruses or ransomware, to hacking attempts designed to infiltrate systems and steal sensitive information. Some examples of digital security measures include firewalls and encryption software. 

**Human security** involves protecting data against potential threats caused by human behavior or actions. These threats can be unintentional, such as an employee unknowingly downloading a malicious email attachment. Others are intentional, such as an employee intentionally leaking confidential data. Some examples of human security measures include employee security training and strong password policies. 

**Physical security** involves protecting tangible assets against threats. These physical assets support digital infrastructure, such as workstations, server rooms, and data centers. And the threats to these assets can be intentional or unintentional, such as theft, tampering, or natural disasters. Some examples of physical security measures include surveillance systems, access control measures, and disaster recovery plans.

objective:

- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

**Confidentiality** means keeping data secret; that is, only authorized people can access or disclose the data. For example, software companies typically keep their applications’ source code secret for competitive advantage. To reduce the chances of a source code leak, they restrict access to only the employees who need it. Confidentiality also covers people’s private data. One example is that your healthcare provider must ensure that data collected while treating you, such as diagnoses or prescriptions, stays private. With few exceptions, only you, your doctor, and authorized medical staff should have access to that data.

In practice, confidentiality involves implementing safeguards that give the right level of access to the right set of users at the right times, using the right methods.

**Integrity** means ensuring that data is trustworthy and accurate by protecting it from unauthorized modification and destruction. Say you spend $10 on a pizza. You might not care whether that purchase is confidential. But what if something alters the transaction amount and you end up spending $10,000 instead? Note that the integrity of this transaction might have been compromised intentionally or unintentionally. Also, consider that although the cause of the error might be technical, it might be human, too. Maybe someone entered the wrong payment amount.

To preserve integrity, you must also prevent unauthorized people from editing the data. In this sense, integrity and confidentiality overlap.

**Availability** means ensuring timely and reliable access to and use of the data. For example, you expect 24x7 online access to your bank account. To meet that expectation, your bank must implement and maintain sufficient resources to keep online banking available and functioning properly.

But timely access does not always mean immediate or even continuous access. For example, when you request school transcripts, you might need to wait several days for school employees to locate, process, and send out the documents. And if the school provides transcripts electronically, it might limit the time frame in which recipients can access them. Regardless, the data is available within and for a reasonable amount of time.

- **Example**
    
    Consider some examples to put the objectives of the CIA triad into context.
    
    - **Confidentiality** might be the most crucial objective for government intelligence agencies. These agencies handle sensitive data relevant to national security, ongoing investigations, intelligence reports, and other classified information. An unauthorized leak of this information might help criminals plan more successful illegal activities. It might even put lives in danger.
    - **Integrity** might be the most crucial objective for banks. Financial transactions, central to banks’ business, rely heavily on data’s accuracy and consistency. Unauthorized modifications, deliberate or not, can lead to significant financial losses or legal repercussions.
    - **Availability** might be the most crucial objective for an online retailer. As a customer, you probably expect to be able to shop for anything you want online, any time of day. Any downtime, lag, or disruption in services might lead you to take your business elsewhere. It might also reduce your trust in the company and damage the company’s reputation. Companies want to ensure that their website maintains constant uptime, loads quickly, and processes transactions without errors.

 

# **Controls**

To meet each objective of the CIA triad, you need controls. In cybersecurity, controls are safeguards or countermeasures to avoid, detect, counteract, or minimize security risks to physical, tangible, or digital property.

Consider these standard controls for preserving confidentiality.

- **Encryption** converts your data into a form that only someone with the decryption key can understand.
- **Access controls** are measures designed to ensure that only the correct people can view, modify, or share data. If you use password protection, you’re using an access control. Access controls also include biometrics, such as fingerprints or retinal scans, that ensure that only authorized people can access the data.
- **Patch management** involves updating system software. Regularly updating system software fixes potential security weak points that attackers can exploit.

Consider these standard controls for preserving integrity.

- **Checksums** are mathematical algorithms that generate a unique value for a data set. If the data changes, the checksum will also change, alerting you to the alteration.
- **Access controls** and **user permissions** can limit who can change data and what changes they can make.
- **Data backups** can help restore data to its correct state if changes occur.
- **Audit trails** can track and record all changes made to data. They give you a clear record of who made a change and when they made it.

Consider these standard controls for preserving availability.

- **Redundant systems** and **data backup procedures** help protect against data loss or system failure. You might use multiple servers or store data in multiple locations.
- **Antimalware software** and **firewalls** protect systems from attacks that can disrupt services.
- **Disaster recovery** and **business continuity plans** lay out the steps needed to restore services quickly and efficiently in case a disruption occurs, minimizing downtime.

# **Module 2**

# **Key elements of cybersecurity**

**Introduction**

You can secure information assets in many ways. Deciding on the best approach is important in cybersecurity.

- **Example**
    
    Imagine you have an expensive painting that you need to protect. One option can be hiring security guards to stand by the painting and constantly watch it. Another option can be requiring all prospective visitors to your painting to make a monetary deposit or seek insurance confirmation. One more option can be installing laser trip wires, security cameras, and motion sensors to detect unknown people.
    
    Each option has advantages and disadvantages; sometimes, relying on only one option might not be enough to protect valuable items. The same applies when trying to secure the information assets of an organization or person.
    

When thinking about cybersecurity, you should consider three key elements:

- Education
- Process
- Technology

To keep attackers at bay, organizations should focus their efforts on these three areas. In this module, you’ll examine each in detail.

### **Education**

Education and awareness are among the most effective ways to improve an organization’s cybersecurity. You can hold regular training sessions to teach employees the importance of cybersecurity and their role in maintaining it. A culture of awareness around cybersecurity reduces the chances that employees engage in risky behavior and increases the chances of them reporting suspicious activity. In short, education and awareness build a human firewall that often catches threats that technology misses.

### **Process**

In organizations, most activities follow a clearly defined set of steps. These processes can aid cybersecurity by considering security at each step or hinder cybersecurity by frustrating the user.

Imagine a process that makes users complete a 20-question survey whenever they wish to report suspicious activity. Many users, who can contribute useful information, might be deterred and give up on the process because of the lengthy survey.

Good processes have the following attributes:

- They are **clear and as easy as possible**. During the process, what to do at every stage should be obvious. Processes should not use unnecessary jargon or be ambiguous.
- They are **accessible or well known**. All users who can follow a process at any stage should know how to access the process. A good example of this commonly being done well is with fire evacuations in buildings. Most people know where the nearest evacuation points are because of good signage.
- They are **consistent**. Processes should not contradict each other, if possible. If a process has a lot of exceptions or deviations, it increases complexity. Later, you will learn how cyberattackers can exploit this inconsistency during attacks.

Technology is all your organization’s underlying infrastructure.

Within cybersecurity, this infrastructure typically includes controls such as device encryption, network perimeter defenses, and antimalware technologies.

Within business, good uses of technology solve problems without creating new ones for their users.

An example of good technical security is device management software, which can track software patch statuses and apply updates. This software is often an essential tool for large organizations. If implemented correctly, then the technology is non-intrusive and users will be secured passively. If implemented poorly, then users might try to disable the software entirely.

The following table shows some technological leaps for security, their perceived drawbacks, and some downsides to their introduction from the user perspective.

| **Technological leap** | **Business benefit** | **Perceived drawback** | **Undesirable user response** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Automated patch management** | All software is up to date | Interruptions to use of device | User does not power down devices |
| **High complexity mandatory passwords** | Harder for attackers to guess passwords | Tedious to use | P@ssw0rd! |
| **Mandatory passwords expire after 30 days** | Passwords cannot be compromised for long periods | Predictably repetitive | PasswordJan to then PasswordFeb |
| **Encrypted emails** | Attackers cannot read emails in transit | Additional configuration and complexity | Disable encryption feature |

You can understand why organizations should educate users on the reasons for introducing the technology and why perceived drawbacks might be necessary.

# **Module 3**

# **Risk management**

**Introduction**

Risks are part of everyday life and something that we are all instinctively familiar with. A **risk** is the possibility of something happening with a negative consequence.

Managing risk is at the heart of most businesses and the core of many industries. For example, think of the insurance industry. An insurance company assesses the risk associated with insuring a person or entity. First, it determines the likelihood of an incident and the probability of someone making a claim if the incident occurs. Then, it sets premiums accordingly. It absorbs the potential financial risk from its clients in return for these regular premium payments.

Good businesses understand and manage risks effectively to give them a competitive advantage.

### **Risk valuation**

All risks are not equally important. Some risks require urgent attention, while others can be ignored. More significant risks are known as **high risks**. You can use this basic equation to calculate the value of a risk:

# **Risk value** = Consequence × Likelihood

- **Consequence** is the impact and associated damages.
- **Likelihood** is how often the risk impact occurs.
    
    

The risk value equation quantifies the significance of a risk. It’s the product of the potential consequence of a risk occurring and the probability of its occurrence. If the consequence of a risk is high (severe impact) and its likelihood is also high (very probable), then the risk value will be significant. This high risk would require immediate attention and mitigation. A risk with a low consequence or likelihood wouldn’t require such immediate attention.

Ideally, for mathematical reasons, it would be great if good statistical information existed for every risk. If, for example, you know that one in 10 cars will experience a flat tire in a given year, then you can easily work out the associated risk value.

- **Example**
    
    An example of the risk value equation applied to the previous flat tire scenario might be as follows. Someone might lose a day’s productivity because they got a flat tire on the way to work. The **consequence** of this risk is the loss of one day of work. Though this consequence is annoying, remember that the **likelihood** of the risk is low: one in 10 cars a year. Thus, you might assess the overall risk value to be low.
    

In cybersecurity, likelihood is hard to measure directly because of the constant evolution of technology and the involvement of outside attackers. Generally, the likelihood of an organization experiencing an attack depends partly on three attributes:

# **Likelihood** = Adversary capability × Adversary motivation × Vulnerability severity

**Adversary capability** includes the attacker’s resources, technology access, and expertise. High adversary capability indicates that the attacker has the tools, means, and proficiency to exploit vulnerabilities, thus posing a greater risk. Conversely, an attacker with low capability might not be able to exploit complex vulnerabilities, thus posing a lesser risk.

**Adversary motivation** is the incentive or reason that drives an adversary to attempt a cyberattack. This motivation can come in various forms, such as financial gain, desire for information, political influence, or simply the thrill of disruption.

**Vulnerabilities** are potential weaknesses within a system that someone can exploit to compromise it. For example, a vulnerability can be a login process that does not authenticate a user accurately.

- **Example**
    
    Let’s consider an example to demonstrate how the equation for likelihood works. Imagine that a recently formed hacking group targets a bank. The malicious group is interested in stealing users’ banking login details and passwords.
    
    - You might assess the **adversary capability** as *low* because their organization is new and might not have the latest technology or resources to develop their own tools, if required.
    - You might assess their **motivation** as *high* because they can attempt multiple attacks over a period of time.
    - You might assess an identified **vulnerability** as *high* because it is comparatively easy to exploit. For example, some vulnerabilities have published descriptions online, enabling attackers to mirror attacks easily.

After an organization assesses all its risks, it starts risk management or response. Generally, organizations can choose from the following four responses to a risk. 

## **Acceptance**

The organization **accepts** the risk in its current form. It acknowledges the potential consequences of the risk and is prepared to deal with them if they occur. A senior person within the organization, referred to as a risk owner, makes the decision to accept a risk.

## **Reduction**

The organization decides a risk is too large to accept and aims to **reduce** it in some fashion. To reduce the risk, the organization can reduce either its likelihood or consequence. It does so by implementing security controls or patching system vulnerabilities.

## **Transference**

The organization chooses to **transfer** the risk. It can have a third party accept part or all of the risk instead of accepting the risk itself. Transfer typically occurs through insurance or outsourcing. Though the risk remains, another entity manages its impact, reducing the direct threat to the organization.

## **Rejection**

The organization decides a risk is too high and **rejects** it, meaning that the organization withdraws from being affected by it. Rejecting the risk can significantly change business operations. For example, rejection might involve shutting down sites, avoiding markets, or avoiding activities that lead to the risk.

- **Example**
    
    Let’s illustrate these four responses to a risk. Imagine that you are considering starting an at-home bakery business. One risk in any bakery is a fire, which can cause extensive damage. Consider the following responses to this risk.
    
    - **Acceptance:** You examine the risk and, with faith in your baking skills, take the chance that it is unlikely anything will go wrong. Should your baking go wrong, you can repair your kitchen and are prepared to do so.
    - **Reduction:** You decide that you prefer not to put your kitchen and oven at a high level of risk, and you decide to reduce the risk. You can reduce the likelihood of fire-related incidents by installing a smoke detector to provide early warning. You can reduce the consequence of a fire by having a fire suppression system installed. Both options will incur a small cost, but you believe that they are worth it.
    - **Transference:** You go to your insurance company and upgrade your insurance to cover home cooking-related fires. The company performs its own assessment of the risk. Together, you agree on a cost to pay the company to cover the risk. Should your oven catch fire, the company will cover the costs. This arrangement incurs a cost initially but limits your liability.
    - **Rejection:** You decide that the oven-related fire risk is too high. You can change recipes to make cakes without using an oven or not start your business in the first place.

## 

### **Risk appetite**

A **risk appetite** is the level of risk that an organization is willing to accept.

- An organization has a *high* risk appetite if it is willing to accept a high level of risk.
- An organization has a *low* risk appetite if it does not like accepting risk.

In cybersecurity, risk appetite refers to an organization’s willingness to accept the potential consequences of cyberattacks. Organizations with a high risk appetite might take bold initiatives, using the latest technologies and potentially vulnerable systems, to pursue significant competitive advantages. They accept the risk of potential cyberattacks, but also have robust contingencies for when breaches occur.

Conversely, organizations with a low risk appetite are more cautious in their approach to cybersecurity. They might prioritize stability and reliability over competitive advantage, focusing more on protective measures such as firewalls, encryption, and regular system updates. These organizations aim to minimize the risk of cyberattacks as much as possible, even if doing so means missing out on certain opportunities.

Note that neither approach is better. An organization’s level of risk appetite should align with its overall strategic goals and resources. It should also vary by the potential impact of cyberattacks on its operations and reputation.

# **Module 4**

**Common misconceptions about cybersecurity**

**Introduction**

There are a lot of misconceptions about cybersecurity today. They range from unrealistic Hollywood clichés about the process of attacking a computer system to outdated stereotypes of people who work in the industry.

## **Everyone who works in cybersecurity comes from an IT background.**

Most cybersecurity roles rely on IT in part or entirely. But not all the roles firmly depend on that background. Because cybersecurity covers so much, employers search for talent in many areas. Skills range from people management and communication to mathematics and data science. Having diverse experiences and skills also helps teams approach problems in new ways, which is valuable.

## **All hackers are criminals.**

The term *hacker* historically refers to someone who enjoys adapting things and discovering how they work. This definition got mixed up with people who illegally tried to gain access to computer systems to hijack their operations. Today, thousands of computer hackers are employed in a variety of IT roles and contribute toward the legal understanding of IT systems as part of many businesses. Their curiosity and drive are invaluable in ensuring that organizations build IT systems safely and securely.

## **Cybersecurity is something I can’t do.**

Because of the constantly evolving areas in cybersecurity and its vast scope, the field offers something for everyone. The diversity of roles requires a great diversity of skills. Those skills can range from strategic analysis and anticipating the evolving landscape of IT businesses to vigilance and patience in system monitoring roles. Note that a lot of education and training is available for anyone wanting to advance in this field.

## **I’m too old or too young to work in this industry.**

A good litmus test for the diversity of a team is to check how many decades are covered by the team’s composition. A good team will have a diverse range of experiences and life views. Cybersecurity needs to examine problems with both fresh **and** experienced perspectives. With such a diverse team, you get a range of ideas and solutions instead of narrow, one-sided views of problems

# **Module 5**

**Laws and ethics**

**Introduction**

Cybercrime is quite a new concept, having only developed within the last 30 years. Before that, people who used computers maliciously had to be prosecuted using a combination of theft and telegraphy acts, which were not that applicable.

Today, a wide-ranging set of international laws govern the use of computing technologies and the protection of the information residing within them. These laws affect everyone, and all cybersecurity professionals should have a basic understanding of them.

This module will provide a quick overview of common types of laws and the importance of considering ethics in the digital world.

Let’s review some features or concepts common in computer misuse laws worldwide.

**Important note**

Laws are not the same across the world. They can vary greatly by country. You should check and abide by the relevant laws for the country you live in or travel to. Some governments have written their laws to be more prohibitive than others so that a legal action in one might be illegal in another.

If you are in doubt, seek legal advice.

# **Unapproved use or control of a computer device**

- Many laws prohibit unauthorized or unapproved access or use of a computing device.
- This catch-all barrier means that hijacking computers through technical material or forcing access to a person’s account is banned.
- **Example**
    
    An example is placing a fake login screen on a website to steal a set of user passwords and using them to spy on someone’s account.
    

# **Preventing others from legitimate use**

- These laws attempt to cover attacks on the availability of computer resources, such as networking capabilities.
- Actions that degrade the quality of service for others, or prevent it entirely, will usually be covered within these laws.
- **Example**
    
    An example is overloading a server or networking switch by sending it too many packets of information to process.
    

# **Aiding other criminals or designing malware**

- 
    
    These laws refer to helping others commit computer misuse offenses, such as being an accomplice.
    
- 
    
    One such way of helping others is by writing malicious software, commonly known as malware.
    
- 
    
    The intent behind these laws is to help with breaking up criminal gangs.
    
- **Example**
    
    An example is producing a program in which an attacker can access another person’s machine remotely without the owner’s awareness.
    

Cybercrime laws aren’t limited to computer misuse. Let’s explore other notable laws common in numerous countries.

# **Unauthorized data alteration**

- 
    
    Laws exist to prevent unauthorized alteration, deletion, or blocking of personal data.
    
- 
    
    Unauthorized alteration includes altering data in a way that can harm a person or an organization.
    
- **Example**
    
    An example is an attacker hacking into a financial institution’s database and changing account balances. This act leads to unauthorized data alteration and causes significant financial harm to the organization and its clients.
    

# **Prohibited software**

- 
    
    Laws are in place against creating, using, or distributing software designed for committing cybercrimes.
    
- 
    
    Such software includes malware, such as viruses, and hacking tools.
    
- **Example**
    
    An example is an attacker sending an email with a seemingly harmless file attached, such as a PDF file. But when the recipient opens the file, a virus within it runs, infecting the recipient’s device. Laws prohibit distributing malware through means such as email.
    

# **Cyberstalking and harassment**

- 
    
    Cyberstalking and harassment laws curb harmful or threatening behavior online.
    
- 
    
    Common examples of this behavior include stalking, bullying, or intimidating others on the internet.
    

### **Discussion on ethics**

As the laws vary across the world, so do ethics. Lively debate continues about many aspects of ethics within cybersecurity. For example, should organizations be permitted to leave booby-trapped files within their infrastructure, awaiting an attacker to trigger one? Many argue that this practice is ethically sound. But under most legal frameworks, such an action is illegal because the trapped files are considered malware.

Let’s examine some of the most important ethical debates in cybersecurity today.

Many nations have established cyberwarfare units to safeguard national security. These units protect critical infrastructure, conduct surveillance, and launch cyberattacks. The laws and regulations governing these units vary considerably and can be ambiguous. Whether laws of traditional warfare should apply to the cyber realm is a contentious issue, and no worldwide consensus exists yet.

The same concerns apply to other government agencies and their operations. Though many governments have implemented laws to safeguard their citizens’ data privacy, debate continues about the extent to which government surveillance is ethical. Governments must balance national security concerns and individual privacy rights.

Ethical debates surrounding cybersecurity have existed for as long as the IT industry itself. These debates are a good sign of a healthy industry reaching maturity and its participants displaying integrity by considering these important issues.

To illustrate the complexity of the laws and ethics of cybersecurity, check out the following examples of how the areas of legality and ethics overlap.

| **Legal** | **Ethical** | **Legal and ethical** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| • Collecting excessive data on a product or user
• Collating public posts or online information without consent
• Posting deceptive content online | • Performing certain scam-baiting activities
• Hunting down attackers using active defense
• Placing booby traps for prospective attackers
• Performing certain whistleblowing activities | • Conducting normal IT system testing
• Reviewing open-source code
• Following responsible disclosure policies for vulnerabilities |

# **Module 1**

**Threat actor groups**

**Introduction**

Cybersecurity professionals often use the term *threat actor* instead of *attacker*.

An **attacker**, or **cyberattacker**, is someone who tries to bypass system or network security without authorization for malicious purposes. A **threat actor**, or **malicious actor**, is an entity that poses a cybersecurity threat. Examples of such entities include people, groups, or organizations. Simply put, a threat actor is a potential attacker. They might not have tried to attack yet, but they intend to do so. While the terms attacker and threat actor have similar meanings, threat actor emphasizes the **potential** threat that the entity poses.

Cybersecurity professionals often discuss threat actors in terms of threat actor groups. These groups vary substantially in motivation, resources, and techniques. In this module, you’ll learn about the five main threat actor groups:

- 
    
    Script kiddie
    
- 
    
    Hacktivist
    
- 
    
    Criminal gang
    
- 
    
    Nation-state hacker
    
- 
    
    Malicious insider
    

# **Script kiddie**

Script kiddies are the least advanced group. A **script kiddie**, or novice hacker, is someone who uses programs, often basic hacking tools, without truly understanding what is happening behind the scenes. Script kiddies typically rely on automated programs and techniques that more experienced hackers create. But they don’t understand the concepts underlying how these tools work. And though they might display a basic understanding of networking and programming, they often lack technical skills, patience, or strategic intent.

# **Overview of script kiddie characteristics**

- 
    
    In practice, this demographic is mostly teenagers or young adults who are self-taught through forums, videos, and experimentation.
    
- 
    
    For many script kiddies, the main motivations for their hacking efforts are reputation, status in the eyes of the hacking community, entertainment, or settling grudges.
    
- 
    
    From a resourcing standpoint, script kiddies rely on off-the-shelf penetration testing tools and publicly available exploits.
    
- 
    
    Script kiddies use artificial intelligence tools, such as chatbots, to create malicious scripts for them.
    
- 
    
    In most cases, script kiddies are very underfunded and display little tradecraft knowledge.
    

From a defensive standpoint, organizations must ensure that their patching schedule is effective. If someone develops an easy exploit, attackers will probably deploy it. Defenses must be formidable enough to ensure that another target appears easier, which should be a sufficient deterrent.

# **Hacktivist**

The term *hacktivist* combines *hacker* and *activist*. **Hacktivists** seek political or economic change and use hacking as a means to achieve it.

# **Overview of hacktivist characteristics**

- 
    
    The defining attribute of hacktivists is that they are driven by ideological reasons.
    
- 
    
    Various types of people make up hacktivist groups. Like script kiddie groups, hacktivist groups include impressionable amateurs. But when causes align on a highly topical issue, hacktivists are joined by more experienced members within the IT security community.
    
- 
    
    The aims of hacktivist groups define their motivations. Their aims vary enormously. Generally, a group’s aim involves supporting one cause that members believe in, such as a side in a Middle East conflict or political activities.
    
- 
    
    Hacktivists use a range of basic tools that can be very effective at scale. Denial-of-service (DoS) programs are a notable example in this area.
    
- 
    
    A single script kiddie poses little threat. But hundreds of them united by a common motive launching parallel attacks can be significantly more challenging to deal with.
    
- 
    
    The most famous example of this group is the hacking collective called [Anonymous(opens in a new tab)](https://www.britannica.com/topic/Anonymous-hacking-group). Anonymous is a decentralized international hacktivist group known for cyberattacks against corporations and governments.
    

If an organization does business in a sensitive area, such as animal testing or political causes, then it might come under a sustained attack from hacktivists. Such organizations must be astute. Having only good defenses in place is not enough to deter all attacks, so organizations should have a plan and methods to cope with a sustained attack.

# **Profile of a hacktivist**

| **Who are they?** | **What is their objective?** |
| --- | --- |
| Driven idealists forming loose coalitions | Want to bring about a change |
| **What resources do they have?** | **How do you protect against them?** |
| Operate at scale with varying tools, and the biggest attribute is size | Ensure defenses can cope with an extended disruptive attack |

# **Criminal gang**

As long as there is easy money to make, criminals will be a problem. The internet has introduced a new method for criminals to prey on victims with an unprecedented scale, range, and ease. Rather than run risks in person, aspiring criminals can send millions of infected emails from halfway around the world and secure a ransom from a victim before transferring funds into cryptocurrencies to evade conventional policing methods. Capturing these criminals is extremely taxing. And because of international laws, securing a prosecution is nearly impossible. Sadly, most criminals are aware of these facts.

# **Overview of criminal gang characteristics**

- 
    
    Criminal gangs are the fastest-growing threat actor group.
    
- 
    
    Within the group are a range of activities. Consider the following examples:
    
    - Gangs can run ransomware attacks, where victims must pay to regain access to their resources.
    - Gangs can commit conventional theft of customer data or intellectual property.
- 
    
    Being a cybercriminal is a full-time and potentially lucrative job. Gangs can range from a few people to multinational gangs with hundreds of members. You’ll often find specialists within each gang, and they can trade information on the dark web. Consequently, criminal gangs are quite advanced and well-organized.
    
- 
    
    From a resourcing standpoint, criminal gangs provide cybercrime services and products. For example, gangs sell malicious software that steals personal information for financial gain. From a financial perspective, the criminals will always adopt the quickest and easiest get-rich-quick scheme.
    

To protect against a criminal gang, organizations should use effective defenses for critical assets. Discovering ransomware on an employee’s laptop might cause inconvenience to the company. But discovering ransomware on a production server can be devastating.

The **dark web** is a subset of the internet comprised of websites accessible only through specialized web browsers. Activity on these sites is encrypted, private, and anonymous, making the dark web a popular hub for cybercriminals. However, some people use the dark web for legitimate reasons, such as political activists who use it to communicate anonymously to avoid government persecution.

# **Profile of a criminal gang**

| **Who are they?** | **What is their objective?** |
| --- | --- |
| Groups of people in national and international teams | Make money |
| **What resources do they have?** | **How do you protect against them?** |
| A broad range of tools and equipment bought and traded on the dark web | Have a fully trained workforce with protections around critical assets and backups |

# **Nation-state hacker**

Nation-state attackers receive the most media attention of all threat actor groups, perhaps unduly. Many military organizations worldwide consider cyberspace a fifth sphere of conflict alongside sea, land, air, and space. And many nations have demonstrated the ability to project power across national borders to a great and expanding variety of consequences.

# **Overview of nation-state hacker characteristics**

- 
    
    The role of nation-state hackers is to provide a strategic advantage to their respective countries. Advantages can range from reconnaissance and information collection, such as traditional spying or signals intelligence, to information subversion and manipulation.
    
- 
    
    Members of these organizations are well-educated or trained and cover a range of backgrounds. They work full-time and typically work at the forefront of their respective fields.
    
- 
    
    Their motivations typically align closely with political or strategic objectives. A recent example is the Russian activities concerning the 2016 US presidential election. The aim was to interfere with the election and increase political and social discord.
    
- 
    
    From a resourcing standpoint, nation-state hackers can access advanced research, dedicated infrastructure teams, and tremendous political support.
    
- 
    
    Nation-state hackers are now using advanced artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) tools to automate their attacks, making them more sophisticated and harder to detect. Also, with the rise of Internet of Things (IoT) devices, nation-state hackers have many more targets to attack.
    

Protection against determined nation-state hackers is highly challenging for organizations. Doing so effectively requires fully capable and coordinated security defenses.

# **Profile of a nation-state hacker**

| **Who are they?** | **What is their objective?** |
| --- | --- |
| Highly trained and educated specialists | Follow strategic, multi-year plans on a wide range of issues |
| **What resources do they have?** | **How do you protect against them?** |
| Huge budgets, advanced tools, and advanced research | Incredibly difficult; need fully coordinated defenses around every aspect of the organization |

# **Malicious insider**

Malicious insiders are arguably the most concerning threat actor group. An **insider** is someone authorized to access an organizational resource, such as a system or data. A **malicious insider** intends to use that access to harm that resource or organization.

# **Overview of insider threat characteristics**

- 
    
    Some insiders have a negative mindset toward the organization from the start. Others become resentful over time.
    
- 
    
    Motivations vary greatly and can cover just about everything. Financial interests and bitterness are two of the most common motivations. Other motivations include notoriety or fame.
    
- 
    
    Insiders rarely rely on technical skills to attack. Some might use social engineering, which involves manipulating others into divulging confidential information usable for fraudulent purposes, such as gaining system access. But typically, insiders use their own corporate access and permissions.
    
- 
    
    One common insider threat is an employee being extorted into giving someone access to the employee’s corporate accounts. Another common example is a disgruntled employee who steals corporate secrets before being fired. Perhaps the most famous insider attack of all time was Edward Snowden, who stole many National Security Agency (NSA) files from the US before giving them to WikiLeaks.
    

Defense against insider threats is best achieved by vetting employees, managing effectively, and applying technical controls. Resorting to technical controls might seem like too easy of a solution for companies, but it frequently fails because they are trying to stop users who are familiar with the system. Often, many warning signs precede an inside attack. Some examples of warning signs that someone is planning an attack include working alone, expressing resentment, producing lower-quality work, or doing unexplained activities. Identifying these signs can help prevent an attack.

# **Profile of an insider threat**

| **Who are they?** | **What is their objective?** |
| --- | --- |
| Staff members who work against an organization’s interests, either deliberately or accidentally | Seek revenge or make money |
| **What resources do they have?** | **How do you protect against them?** |
| No budget or resources are required; use granted access | Monitor staff carefully and ensure the organization’s culture is effective to prevent issues |

**Note:** These descriptions of the types of cyberattackers are not always precise. In operations, hacktivists might recruit script kiddies, and nation-state hackers might recruit criminal gangs. Also, some cyberattackers disguise their work to appear less advanced than they are. These facts can make attributing threats to the correct party difficult.

You’ve learned about five common types of cyberattackers who have personal motivations or threatening, often illegal motivations. But not all hackers hack for malicious purposes. **Offensive security researchers** choose to use and monetize their skill set for good rather than criminal or exploitative activity. Often called **ethical hackers**, they take on a hacker mindset to use the same methods as real-life attackers but with the goal of testing and fortifying systems to help clients and consumers be better protected from the real incident.

Here are two leading cybersecurity experts: Brian Krebs and Georgia Wiedman. Both use their skill sets to offer organizations worldwide valuable and often highly-paid advice and knowledge.

**Brian Krebs**

Brian is a celebrated journalist who investigates cybercrime. He started his career as a reporter for The Washington Post, where he wrote for the Security Fix blog from 1995 to 2009 and pushed the boundaries of cybersecurity reporting. Today, he owns the hugely popular blog [Krebs on Security(opens in a new tab)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/) and was named 2019’s “[Cybersecurity Person of the Year(opens in a new tab)](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2019/12/ciso-magazine-honors-krebsonsecurity/)” by CISO MAG.

**Fun fact:** Brian’s interest in cybersecurity started after a Chinese hacking group took his entire home network captive.

**Georgia Wiedman**

Georgia is a serial entrepreneur in the cybersecurity space and has worked as a penetration tester, security researcher, speaker, trainer, and author. She has gained a large following through her work in smartphone exploitation and mobile device security as the founder and CTO of [Shevirah(opens in a new tab)](https://www.shevirah.com/).

**Fun fact:** Georgia has spoken and trained audiences worldwide at venues such as the NSA, West Point, and Black Hat.

# **Module 2**

# **Types of cyberattacks**

**Introduction**

Attackers can use various methods to enter and exploit systems. Some attacks target vulnerabilities in technology. Others exploit vulnerabilities in humans, specifically the flawed ways in which humans interact with systems.

In this module, you’ll explore some of the most common types of cyberattacks:

- 
    
    Denial-of-service (DoS) attack
    
- 
    
    Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack
    
- 
    
    Phishing
    
- 
    
    Spear phishing
    
- 
    
    Malware
    
- 
    
    Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack
    
- 
    
    Domain Name System (DNS) attack
    

# **Denial-of-service (DoS) attack**

- 
    
    A **denial-of-service (DoS) attack** is any attack that causes a complete or partial system outage.
    
- 
    
    DoS can occur when a person or system floods a website or online service with too much network traffic, much like a traffic jam on a road. This traffic overflow makes the website or service slow down or shut down completely, denying access to legitimate users.
    
- 
    
    DoS can also occur when traffic consumes enough system resources to slow down or crash the system.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An attacker uses a billion laughs attack, also known as an XML bomb, where the attacker creates a small, seemingly harmless piece of code in an Extensible Markup Language (XML) document. The attacker then submits this document to the target organization’s system. When the system processes the code, the code continually replicates. The replications consume more and more system resources, eventually slowing down or even crashing the system.
    

# **Distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack**

- 
    
    A **distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack** is an attack that comes from multiple sources simultaneously to cause a complete or partial system outage.
    
- 
    
    To perform DDoS attacks, attackers use bots. A **bot**, or **zombie**, is an internet-connected device infected with malware that enables the attacker to control the device remotely. For DDoS attacks, attackers manipulate multiple bots under the same instance, forming a network of bots called a **botnet**. A botnet can include hundreds or even thousands of bots, each sending data or requesting access from the target server simultaneously. This sudden traffic surge overwhelms the server, causing a denial of service to its users.
    
- 
    
    Attackers can use AI to analyze patterns and predict the optimal number of bots needed to effectively overwhelm a target’s server without wasting resources. AI also helps attackers monitor each bot’s performance in real time to maximize effectiveness.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An attacker can send many page requests to a web server over a brief period, overloading the server. Similarly, spikes in user demand on ticket sale websites can overload systems.
    

# **Phishing**

- 
    
    **Phishing** is the practice of sending messages, seemingly from a trusted source, to trick users into taking a specific action.
    
- 
    
    It combines social engineering and technical trickery.
    
- 
    
    After opening the message, unsuspecting users might install malware, enable remote access, or divulge confidential information.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An attacker might send an email with a file attachment or link to a fake website. When the recipient clicks the attachment or link, they unwittingly install malware on their computer.
    

# **Spear phishing**

- 
    
    **Spear phishing** is a type of phishing that targets a specific person, group, or organization.
    
- 
    
    Attackers take time to research targets. Attackers use this research to create personal and relevant messages, making them more effective.
    
- 
    
    Some attackers use AI to automate the email creation process. They generate personalized and convincing emails that are more likely to deceive users into revealing sensitive information.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An attacker collects a target’s details from social media and then calls the target, pretending to be a bank representative. The attacker claims that the target’s account is compromised and asks them to transfer money to a *safe* bank account. The attack is convincing because the attacker uses legitimate knowledge about the client.
    

# **Malware**

- 
    
    Malware is a catch-all term for malicious software. **Malware** is software designed to harm data or systems without the user’s informed consent.
    
- 
    
    It often triggers secretly when a user runs a program or downloads a file. This user action is often unintentional.
    
- 
    
    Once active, malware can block access to data and programs, steal information, and make systems inoperable.
    
- 
    
    AI can help malware adapt to evade detection, enabling them to cause more damage within an infected system.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Many types of malware exist and often, the malware’s name indicates its function. For example, **keyloggers** capture a victim’s keystrokes, and **ransomware** holds a victim’s files captive in exchange for a ransom payment.
    

# **Man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack**

- 
    
    A **man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack** occurs when attackers insert themselves into communications between a client and server.
    
- 
    
    With this attack, attackers can view everything that both sides send and receive.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An attacker might set up a free wifi hotspot in a popular public location. If someone connects to that network, the attacker can examine their communications. In turn, the attacker can redirect the victim to a fake login screen or insert advertisements over web pages.
    

# **Domain Name System (DNS) attack**

- 
    
    The **Domain Name System (DNS)** is one of the core protocols used on the internet. With the DNS protocol, a computer can resolve a domain to an IP address. For example, imagine a user types **bmw.com** into a browser’s search bar and then presses **Enter**. The DNS protocol resolves this domain name to the IP address for the main BMW website, taking the user to the site. This function is convenient because domain names are far easier to remember than IP addresses!
    
- 
    
    A **DNS attack** targets the DNS by manipulating or disrupting the resolution of domain names and possibly redirecting users or hindering access to websites. It involves tactics such as domain hijacking and cache poisoning.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Attackers associated with the Roaming Mantis criminal gang have compromised wireless routers so that entering the URL for a valid website redirects the user to a malicious website. This site delivers malware called Wroba to the user’s device. When the device is infected, the attackers can use it as a bot, and then use it to compromise other wireless routers.1
    

# **Structured query language (SQL) injection**

- 
    
    **Structured query language (SQL)** is a programming language for accessing, managing, and querying databases.
    
- 
    
    **SQL injection** is the placement of malicious code in SQL queries, usually via web page input. With a successful attack, attackers can run common commands, including commands to delete the database itself!
    
- 
    
    SQL injection is one of the most common web hacking techniques.
    
- 
    
    Attackers can use AI to automate the process of discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities in a database’s security.
    
- 
    
    **Example**
    
    In the UK, two teenagers managed to target TalkTalk’s website in 2015. Using SQL injection, they stole hundreds of thousands of customer records from a database that was remotely accessible.
    

# **AI in cyberattacks**

Attackers are increasingly turning to AI. With AI, attackers can enhance the structure and sophistication of their attacks in several ways.

***Select each section to learn more.***

## **Task automation–**

AI can automate repetitive tasks, enabling attackers to launch attacks at a speed and scale otherwise impossible. For example, AI can automate the creation and dissemination of phishing emails, increasing the likelihood of success.

## **Detection evasion–**

AI can help attackers create malware that changes and adapts to evade detection by traditional antivirus solutions. To do so, attackers often use machine learning (ML) algorithms that can learn from each detection attempt and alter the malware’s code to avoid future detections.

## **Target identification–**

AI can help attackers identify optimal targets for attacks. Sophisticated algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data to identify vulnerable systems or high-value targets, thus increasing the effectiveness of attacks.

## **Social engineering–**

Attackers can use AI technologies, such as deep learning, to enhance the effectiveness of social engineering attacks with convincing fake audio and video content. One notable example is deepfakes, which are fake images, videos, or audio created through deep learning. For example, an attacker might call a victim and use an audio deepfake to impersonate someone that the victim knows and trusts.

You’ve learned about a few types of cyberattacks impacting people and organizations today. Note the following points about these examples:

- 
    
    DoS attacks on organizations are commonly reported in the news.
    
- 
    
    Phishing attacks are the most effective on a personal basis.
    
- 
    
    Malware attacks are increasing in number and constantly evolving.

# **Module 3    Structure of a cyberattack**

**Introduction**

As computer systems change, so do the ways in which they can become compromised. For example, a specific type of malware might work only on a computer running an outdated version of a web browser. After the browser is updated with a security patch, attackers can’t use the same malware attack.

Even though cyberattack techniques have evolved with time and today they use AI capabilities, you can still examine the overall **structure of a typical cyberattack**. In this module, you’ll learn about two methods that cybersecurity professionals use for this purpose: the Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® framework and the MITRE ATT&CK matrix.

# **Lockheed Martin Cyber Kill Chain® framework**

**Image source:** [Lockheed Martin(opens in a new tab)](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html)

[Lockheed Martin Corporation(opens in a new tab)](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/index.html) is an American global aerospace, defense, security, and advanced technologies company. Researchers at Lockheed Martin identified parallels between the US military concept of a kill chain, which refers to the structure of a military attack, and intrusions in digital networks. Here, the word chain refers to a series of steps attackers must take to infiltrate a system successfully.

Cybersecurity professionals use this framework to understand and prevent cyberattacks. Each step of the chain represents a different stage of an attack, and the steps must occur in order because each step depends on the previous step’s completion. With this framework, you can view the attack as a process, not a single event.

Now, you’ll examine the seven steps in the [Cyber Kill Chain framework(opens in a new tab)](https://www.lockheedmartin.com/en-us/capabilities/cyber/cyber-kill-chain.html) to better understand a typical cyberattack sequence.

- 
    
    **Step 1: Reconnaissance**
    
    During this step, the attacker gathers information about the target. They can do so through probing digital servers, speaking with people close to the target, or just reading the news!
    
- 
    
    **Step 2: Weaponization**
    
    After identifying a specific vulnerability, the attacker designs a piece of malware to exploit it. This process can range from downloading a database sample, purchasing a tool from a third party, or developing something custom.
    
- 
    
    **Step 3: Delivery**
    
    The attacker must send the chosen malware to the target somehow. Despite more recent technological developments, email is still the most common delivery method. Other methods include website downloads and infected or modified USB flash drives.
    
- 
    
    **Step 4: Exploitation**
    
    When the target activates the malware by opening the infected attachment in the email or accessing the USB flash drive, the malware performs a series of instructed steps. This process varies considerably and depends on many details about the programs and operating system. This process is known as *exploiting a vulnerability*, and the software used to do it is known as **exploit code** or an **exploit**.
    
- 
    
    **Step 5: Installation**
    
    The malware attempts to get some element of persistence within the target system. It can do so by creating **backdoors**, such as through the following methods:
    
    - Creating new accounts
    - Installing remote access programs
    - Introducing new vulnerabilities into the system
    
    These factors mean that even if the original vulnerability is patched, it is too late because the attacker can still access the system through the backdoors that the malware created.
    
- 
    
    **Step 6: Command and control (C2)**
    
    The attacker must establish a method to communicate with the compromised systems. By doing so, the attacker can send instructions and upgrades to the target and receive data back from the target. The attacker can establish communication through websites, direct connections, and even social media sites such as X.
    
- 
    
    **Step 7: Actions on objectives**
    
    After all the previous steps are complete, the attacker can accomplish their objectives. For example, they might steal data, modify data, or destroy key system elements.

# **Module 4  Cybercrime ecosystem**

**Introduction**

Some cyberattackers are motivated by activism or national interest. However, making money is the biggest motivator for cybercrimes. In this module, you’ll examine how cybercriminals make and use their illicit money 

# **Initial cash injection**

So, with a marketplace set up, how do criminals make money? Well, with illegal tactics! They can use one of these three methods.

THeft:

The most direct method for cybercriminals to make money is trying to steal money from targets. They can do so by compromising accounts or banking systems, but the most common means is fraud or deception.

These scams are often technical support scams or similar tricks aimed at persuading a victim to give away bank details, personal information, and other data usable for making money off the victim.

Work for hire:

Sometimes, criminals offer their services to carry out illegal tasks to regular people and organizations. In this model, the criminal does not take money from the victim. Instead, an organization or person pays them.

A typical illegal task performed for hire is using a denial of service (DoS) attack to overload key parts of a service. For example, a criminal might offer an organization or person the ability to disable a competitor or rival. Another common task is stealing a competitor’s intellectual property or destroying their databases.

EXTORTION:

Another way to make money is extortion. In this model, the criminal gains the ability to disrupt a victim by disabling key systems or threatening to divulge sensitive data.

Extortion has become increasingly popular with the advent of ransomware. In a **ransomware** attack, a victim’s key systems and files become encrypted, rendering them inoperable. To restore the systems and files, the victim is asked to pay money as ransom to receive the decryption key.

Other extortion-themed approaches include threatening to divulge organization or customer data, such as embarrassing executive emails or customer databases.

# **Cryptocurrency**

You learned that in ransomware attacks, cybercriminals require victims to pay a ransom. Typically, victims must pay in the cybercriminal’s preferred currency: cryptocurrency. But what exactly is cryptocurrency, and why do cybercriminals prefer it?

**Cryptocurrency** is a digital or virtual currency that uses cryptography to secure financial transactions, control the creation of new currency units or coins, and verify asset transfers. Each cryptocurrency has its own rules and protocols, but they all operate on an emerging technology called blockchain. **Blockchain** is a distributed ledger that records all transactions across a computer network. The system encrypts each transaction, adds it to a block, and then adds that block to a chain of previous blocks. This process creates a permanent and transparent record of all transactions, making altering or manipulating the data difficult.

One of the most well-known cryptocurrencies is Bitcoin. Introduced in 2009, Bitcoin paved the way for developing numerous other cryptocurrencies, often called altcoins.

# **Cryptocurrency in cybercrime**

Cryptocurrencies offer several advantages over traditional currencies, such as faster and cheaper transactions, increased privacy and security, and potential service for unbanked or underbanked individuals. But cryptocurrencies also pose risks, such as volatility in their value and challenges from regulations. The most relevant risk for cybersecurity is their potential use in illicit activities.

Cybercriminals often use cryptocurrencies because the currency is anonymous and typically **decentralized**, meaning that it operates independently of a central authority, such as a government or bank. These features make tracing transactions difficult for law enforcement agencies. Cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, have become the primary currency of the dark web, where criminals trade illicit goods and services. Consider the following examples:

- 
    
    In ransomware attacks, cybercriminals demand payment in Bitcoin because its anonymous nature masks the receiver’s identity.
    
- 
    
    In many money laundering schemes, cybercriminals use Bitcoin to erase the funds’ illicit origins by moving money through virtually untraceable networks.
    

# **Module 5  Social engineering**

**Introduction**

When you think of cybersecurity threats, you probably think of digital threats, such as malware, that exploit vulnerabilities in technology. But attackers can also exploit vulnerabilities in **people** to get what they want.

In this module, you’ll learn about social engineering and the techniques that attackers use to hack people, not technology.

# **What is social engineering?**

Social engineering is the art of making someone do what you want them to do. It overlaps heavily with academic fields involving psychology, biology, and even mathematics.

In cybersecurity, **social engineering** is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into divulging confidential or personal information for fraudulent purposes. Basically, how can someone trick another person into giving up something private? Social engineering attacks are the dark art of using social interactions to trick people into making security mistakes.

Attackers can employ social engineering tactics in person, over the phone, or online through websites, email, and social media.

When an attacker makes someone perform a certain action, the attacker can gain access to sensitive systems, steal assets, or advance a more complex attack. This notion of focusing on persuading or tricking people might sound unreliable. However, many case studies show that social engineering is an incredibly powerful technique.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Effective social engineering tactics can result in defrauding vulnerable people of their savings through **scams and confidence tricks**. For organizations with physical buildings, social engineering also includes **tailgating**, which is when a person enters a secure area without authorization by closely following an authorized person.
    

A social engineering attack typically has these elements.

1. 1
    
    It is **well-researched**. If an attacker is trying to impersonate a member of a company, then they will use the company’s letterhead, jargon, or format to help build credibility. Not all methods are equally effective against everyone. Cyberattackers research to determine the best driver for their target.
    
2. 2
    
    It is **delivered confidently**. In-person, good social engineers are prepared and confident, and they reassure targets. Knowing when to launch an attack and how to develop a rapport with the target is essential. Usually, attackers build up a high-value social engineering attack over a series of exchanges, lending credibility and reducing inhibitions with each exchange. Rushing the attack can backfire and lead to attackers revealing themselves through desperation.
    
3. 3
    
    It is **plausible and realistic**. The best social engineering attacks are often the ones where the victim doesn’t even know that they’ve been tricked.
    

# **Beware of phishing**

**Phishing emails** are one of the most common forms of social engineering, and if you let your guard down, you can fall prey to this tactic. Follow these tips to detect phishing emails, whether personal or business-related. Note that no single phishing email will contain all the signs of phishing mentioned in this list. But the more of these clues that you find in an email, the more likely that it is a phishing attempt.

- 
    
    Consider if you were expecting the email. Does it make sense that the sender chose to contact you? Is the message too good to be true, or does it pressure you to act quickly?
    
- 
    
    Check the sender’s email address. Is the email from someone or a company that you recognize?
    
- 
    
    Look for the salutation. Does it address you with a generic greeting such as “Dear valued member” instead of your name?
    
- 
    
    Search for any language or grammar errors. Does it have poor grammar or a lot of spelling errors?
    
- 
    
    Determine what the email is requesting. Does it ask you to visit a fake or “spoof” website? Does it ask you to call a fake customer service number or open attachments that you did not request?
    
- 
    
    Look for the red flags of a fake request that are typically part of the phishing email. For example, does it ask for your bank information or password?
    
- 
    
    Note any language that is alarming or creates a sense of urgency to act quickly without thinking. Does the email claim that the company will delete your account if you don’t act now? Does it state that a virus has been detected on your system, so you should download and install an attached security patch immediately?
    
- 
    
    Don’t click a link without verifying the URL it points to.
    
    - Does the URL include a non-secure link? To know if the link is secure, check that the URL begins with “https”.
    - Does the URL direct you to a completely different website? Some attackers use URLs that look like legitimate ones. For example, examine this fake URL for PayPal: www.paypall.accountlogin.com/signin. Notice the misspelling of “PayPal”.

# **Important note**

If you receive an email that you think might be phishing, don’t respond in any way, click any links, or open any attachments. Most email services have a method to report an email as spam.When in doubt, you can contact the sender via a trusted channel, such as a previously saved contact phone number. You can also access the service web address from your records.

# **Module 6    Open-source intelligence**

**Introduction**

Interest in open-source intelligence (OSINT) has grown over the last decade, both within the government and private sectors. **Open-source intelligence (OSINT)** is intelligence gathered from publicly available sources. These sources include blogs, news sites, and other publicly available websites. Anyone with reliable internet access, including journalists, researchers, and attackers, can conduct open-source investigations. You can easily collect OSINT without active collection methods, such as hacking or wiretaps.

In this module, you’ll examine the benefits and sources of OSINT. You’ll also learn about the concerns that it presents for organizations and people. You will understand how attackers collect information about a targeted organization or individual using these sources in the public domain. The module focuses on how attackers use OSINT for reconnaissance on larger attacks.

# **Open-source intelligence versus alternatives**

Traditional forms of information gathering can be expensive, complex, and illegal. Examples of such approaches include hacking into private databases, conducting phishing email campaigns, and designing and deploying malware that tracks user activity.

Conversely, open information can be considerably easy and even free to acquire.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    What if a journalist wants to determine a political party member’s location at any time?
    
    They can try to place a piece of malware on the person’s mobile phone illegally to acquire GPS coordinates. But monitoring the person’s social media account might be far simpler. All this approach takes is for one of the politician’s aides to post a location-tagged message or a photo with a recognizable landmark. Though this example seems simple, military units have used the same techniques to track their counterparts in foreign countries, and law enforcement has used them to track criminals and fugitives.
    

Another benefit of open-source intelligence is that it is usually **undetectable to the target**.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    What if an attacker wants to gather information about the control systems inside a power plant?
    
    If they try to scan the power plant’s external network, the attacker might be detected, potentially compromising the secrecy of their infrastructure. Alternatively, the attacker might find a system engineer discussing sensitive plans on a blog. The blogging platform might have access records usable for identifying users such as the attacker. However, the company that owns the power plant would not.
    

# **Module 7    Technical scanning**

**Introduction**

In this module, you’ll learn about technical scanning techniques and why attackers use them. You’ll explore how threat actors use scanning during the reconnaissance, or information gathering, stage of an attack.

Technical scanning techniques play an essential part in an organization’s network administration and analysis. Think about how attackers collect information about computers and networks. While investigating a target device on a network, an attacker might want to learn more about the device’s technical configuration. They might try to find out information such as the following:

- What operating system is in use?
- What services are running on the device?
- Are any of the services vulnerable to well-known exploits?

Let’s explore some typical technical scanning techniques.

- 
    
    Ping test
    
- 
    
    Traceroute
    
- 
    
    Port scanning
    
- 
    
    Vulnerability scanning
    
- 
    
    Search engine for the internet
    
- 
    
    Network scanning
    

# **Ping test**

# **How does it work?**

This diagram shows a phone pinging two IP addresses on its local network and waiting for a response.

![image.png](attachment:b48b81fd-6a88-4cd9-8b5f-d04a573862eb:image.png)

A **ping test** measures the time that it takes for a packet to travel from one device or server to another. A **packet**, or ping, is a small amount of formatted data analogous to the digital version of a postcard.

In a ping test, a scanning device sends an Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packet to the target device’s Internet Protocol (IP) address. This outbound packet is called an **echo request** packet. If the target device replies with an **echo reply** packet, then the scanning device knows that the target device is most likely active and switched on.

# 

# **Traceroute**

# **How does it work?**

This diagram shows a device mapping out its connection between itself and a destination address. A physical analogy for this process is skimming a series of stones on a lake with increasing hops each time.

![image.png](attachment:b56183a5-5da0-4993-b82e-c46ecd31bd09:image.png)

**Traceroute** is another network diagnostic tool. When you run a traceroute, the scanning device sends packets to the target device. These packets have either increasing or decreasing TTLs. When a packet is in transit, and its TTL decreases to zero, the device processing the packet sends back an error message to the scanning device indicating that the packet didn’t reach its destination.

# **What does it provide?**

You can use a traceroute test to map a network and determine how many routers and switches exist between you and your destination. A router is a network’s hardware connection to the internet. A switch integrates all the devices on a network, including the router, allowing for seamless sharing and data transfer among them.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Imagine a target is 12 hops away. If you send a packet with a TTL of 11 toward the target, the packet will fail at the final routing step. The scanning device will receive an error message packet, and this message will reveal the IP address of the device 11 steps away. As the TTL is reduced to one over a few new tests, the traceroute command produces a complete list of the network nodes between the scanner and the target. On Windows, you can run a traceroute by using the following command: **tracert target_name**.
    

# **How does it work?**

In networking, applications are accessible externally through services on digital ports. A port is a connection point that sends or receives data for a specific network service, such as email. Each port is assigned a number in the **Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)**, a collection of internet protocols that make it possible to create and maintain communication between internet-connected devices. Each port is also associated with an IP address. The relationship between IP addresses and ports is like that between a building and its floors: an IP address is like a building, and port numbers are like different floors in that building.

The usual goal of port scanning is to identify a host’s open ports.

- A **host** is a device, such as a server, workstation, laptop, or other smart device, that can communicate with other devices on a network and grant access to devices outside the network.
- An **open** port is one that accepts a connection. Given that a port number is like a floor in a building, an open port is like a floor that you can access through an open door.

Attackers want to find and exploit open ports on hosts. Conversely, network administrators want to close or block these ports while ensuring that legitimate users still have access.

This diagram depicts a port scanner scanning a server. The scanner tests one port at a time to determine if a specific service is available on the port. However, each port rejects the connection, meaning it’s a closed port.

![image.png](attachment:24059469-300b-47e9-963e-d3c09a241673:image.png)

The scanner reports that a port is **closed** if the port rejects the connection or **filtered** if the host gives no response to the scan. No response can mean that a package filter, a type of firewall, is blocking access to the port.

# **What does it provide?**

By working through the list of a host’s well-known ports, a scanner can often determine what the host’s owner uses the device for. The TCP contains 65,536 ports. TCP ports 0 through 1,023 are called **well-known ports**: each has a specific service associated with it, and this association is internationally recognized. Some ports from 1,024 through 49,151 might also have officially registered uses of interest.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    HTTP web activity always occurs on TCP port 80. If a scan reveals that port 80 is open, the investigator knows that some web-based application might be using it. For another example, Windows file sharing occurs on TCP port 445. If attackers know this port is open, they might try to exploit it with malware. Famous ransomware attacks, such as the WannaCry attacks, have targeted this port.
    
    A notable port outside the list of well-known ports is TCP port 3389, the default port for the Microsoft Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP). If attackers know this port is open and available, they can try to hack the remote desktop software.
    

# **Vulnerability scanning**

# **How does it work?**

![image.png](attachment:7148560c-a67b-4e05-8cc6-71416e150127:image.png)

Another form of testing is vulnerability scanning. One of its features is **dynamic scanning**, which simulates hacking techniques, such as SQL injection, to discover vulnerabilities to exploit.

Other standard vulnerability scanning techniques include version and OS detection:

- **Version detection** reveals the version numbers of software, such as Apache web server, running on the host
- **OS detection** reveals the device’s OS, such as macOS.

# **What does it provide?**

Vulnerability scanning is a powerful tool for both organizations to identify vulnerabilities in their network and for attackers to find potential victims. Some organizations run such scans periodically to identify mistakes that need remediation.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    A scanner might attempt to connect to a server and check if it is running an outdated version of an application. If the application is out-of-date with a known vulnerability, then the scanner might attempt to exploit the vulnerability to confirm its existence and report this finding.
    

# **Important note**

Please be aware that dynamic scanning might automatically perform actions considered illegal in some countries. Scan a target only if the owner has given consent. A network vulnerability scan will often be interpreted as the planning stage of an attack.

# **Search engine for the internet**

Another tool for technical scanning is the [Shodan search engine(opens in a new tab)](https://www.shodan.io/). Its website describes the tool as “the world’s first search engine for internet-connected devices”. It is of interest to both malicious attackers and security researchers. It offers a vast catalog of collected scan results spanning billions of records. People can use these stored records to track applications at scale around the world.

# **Network scanning**

**Network scans** collect information about a network by targeting a host. Network and systems administrators rely on network scans to assess the status and security of their organization’s network. Unfortunately, cyberattackers can use these same tools for malicious purposes.

Many network scanning applications exist, but the most well-known scanner is Nmap.

[Nmap(opens in a new tab)](https://nmap.org/), short for Network Mapper, is a free, open-source network scanner available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and other OSs. Though port scanning is its core feature, Nmap provides other valuable features for investigating networks.

Nmap is a command-line program, but most versions also include Zenmap, the official graphical user interface (GUI) of Nmap. [Zenmap(opens in a new tab)](https://nmap.org/zenmap/) makes learning Nmap easier for beginners. With Nmap, you must determine the precise command needed to perform your scan, and the number of options and syntactic requirements can make this challenging. But with Zenmap, you can simply select choices from a user-friendly interface to customize your scan. And if you still want to learn Nmap’s command-line options, Zenmap displays the actual Nmap command and options behind your scan.

# **Module 8 Case studies**

**Introduction**

Cyberattacks are in the news daily, impacting people and organizations across public and private sectors. In this module, you’ll examine three high-profile case studies of cyberattacks to learn the extent of what is possible and happening worldwide. Each case study focuses on a different type of threat actor. These three case studies are part of a growing catalog of security breaches in the international landscape. Lessons learned from these case studies guide future decision-making in cybersecurity.

**Introducing cyberweapons**

When Stuxnet was identified in 2010, it was one of the most advanced and targeted malware collections observed within the security community. Attackers used Stuxnet to attack a specific industry control system and modify key settings. Experts have concluded that the culprits designed it to target centrifuges used within Iranian uranium processing, which is a precursor for nuclear bomb production.

![image.png](attachment:4bcd1553-6498-42a0-82e7-73e783eece2f:image.png)

This attack is interesting for several reasons.

- It was much more technically advanced than any previous malware. Stuxnet exploited four previously unknown security flaws. Cybersecurity professionals refer to such flaws as **zero-day vulnerabilities**. Also, the attack used a pair of compromised digital certificates and concealed itself at a very low level within computing systems.
- The malware spread through infected USB flash drives. A common mistake in cybersecurity is assuming that an adversary cannot introduce malware into the local network if a system is not connected to the wider internet.
- The malware’s authors were persistent. Their targeted campaign continued for months while they tweaked and upgraded the tools that they were using.

In many ways, Stuxnet was the definitive example of a cyberweapon deployed to achieve a tangible military and political objective. The incident made it clear to cybersecurity experts what they can expect for future cyberweapons.

The Los Angeles Unified School District (LAUSD), the US’s second-biggest school district, experienced a ransomware attack in 2022. This attack significantly impacted more than 1000 schools and 600,000 students. The ransomware kept LAUSD officials from accessing their systems and a great deal of critical data. Some examples of this data include Social Security numbers, login credentials, tax forms, legal documents, financial reports, health information, background checks, and student psychological assessments. LAUSD decided not to pay the ransom, following the guidance of cybersecurity experts and law enforcement for handling ransomware attacks. In response, the attackers, a Russian criminal group called Vice Society, released the data on the dark web.1

This breach is one of the largest that the education sector has experienced.1 It demonstrates how attackers can exploit system vulnerabilities and disrupt the functions of critical public services. And LAUSD’s decision not to pay the ransom highlights the difficult choice that institutions face when dealing with ransomware. Overall, the breach exposed the need for robust cybersecurity measures in educational institutions.

# **About this course**

Welcome to the *Cybersecurity: On the Defense* course! In this course, you’ll learn about the defensive side of cybersecurity, meaning organizations and their techniques and tools. You’ll discover basic strategies that organizations take to detect and prevent cyberattacks and how organizations respond when incidents occur. You’ll explore standard encryption practices used to preserve data confidentiality. You’ll also learn about threat intelligence, including its benefits and sources.

# **Module 1   Financial impacts**

**Introduction**

In this module, you’ll learn about the significant financial cost of data breaches. You’ll also explore statistics regarding organizations’ preparedness to combat cyberattacks.

# **Cost of data breaches**

Let’s learn about how detrimental cyberattacks can be to organizations. The cost of cybercrime to organizations can be hard to predict and very damaging.

The annual [Cost of a Data Breach Report 2023(opens in a new tab)](https://www.ibm.com/reports/data-breach), conducted by the Ponemon Institute and sponsored by IBM Security, analyzes data breach costs reported by hundreds of organizations around the world and across industries. According to the 2023 report, **the average total cost of a data breach is USD 4.45 million**. The cost has increased by 15% since 2020.

Now, you’ll review more key facts about the costs of data breaches, all taken from the Cost of a Data Breach 2023 report. The amounts are in US dollars.

Data breaches can cause devastating financial losses.

- 
    
    According to the report, the biggest contributor to these costs is detection and escalation. **Detection and escalation** involve activities related to detecting breaches, such as security audits and forensic investigations.
    
- 
    
    The second biggest contributor is **lost business**. This consequence can linger for years because of the reputational harm that an organization experiences.
    
- 
    
    **Regulatory fines** can also impact an organization. Organizations that host the data of European Union (EU) residents or do business with EU countries face some of the stiffest penalties per the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), an extensive data privacy law and regulation.
    

The rising cost of breaches is a key driver for the cybersecurity industry. And the number of high-profile cases will probably increase as more countries adopt data standards such as those in the GDPR.

# **Facing the challenge of rising attacks**

Hiscox is a global specialist insurer. The [Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report 2023(opens in a new tab)](https://www.hiscoxgroup.com/sites/group/files/documents/2023-10/Hiscox-Cyber-Readiness-Report-2023.pdf) gauges how prepared businesses are to combat cyberattacks. The annual report surveyed over 6,000 cybersecurity professionals worldwide. It found that the cost and number of attacks continue to rise.

Review the report’s key findings.

- 
    
    53% of reporting companies suffered a cyberattack, up 48% from the previous year.
    
- 
    
    The median spent on cybersecurity was USD 155,000, a 39% increase over three years.
    
- 
    
    The median cost for attacks decreased slightly from around USD 16,000 to 17,000. As businesses have spent more money on their cybersecurity measures, the cost of attacks has decreased.
    
- 
    
    One out of eight attacks cost more than USD 250,000.
    
- 
    
    Small businesses, defined as those with under ten employees, spent four times more on cybersecurity than they did two years prior. Still, the number of small businesses that experienced an attack increased from 23% to 36% over three years.
    
- 
    
    One out of three companies experienced consequences from payment diversion fraud, the leading cause of financial loss for businesses. **Payment diversion fraud** is where an attacker tricks an organization into rerouting payments intended for suppliers or other business expenses into a bank account that the attacker controls.
    
- 
    
    One out of five companies received a ransom demand. The percentage of companies paying the ransom dropped from 66% to 63%. The reason for this shift might be better awareness of how to deal with ransomware attacks and that paying ransoms isn’t always the best decision.
    

Regardless of the reasons for the decrease, organizations should continue seeking professional guidance when they experience ransomware attacks. Experts can recommend strategies for recovering data, negotiating with attackers, handling legal consequences, and preventing future attacks.

These statistics show that cyberattacks are an unavoidable cost of doing business. Organizations must increase their cyber resilience and implement effective security strategies.

A good metaphor for a cyberattack is that of a pollutant in the environment. The accumulation of attacks is something that everyone must deal with. Organizations cannot ignore the attacks forever, and doing so only exacerbates the problem.

# **Module 2: Security Strategy**

**Introduction**

Organizations must outline and implement a security strategy to protect themselves from cyberattacks. How can they effectively mitigate threats and prepare for potential breaches?

In this module, you'll learn what a security strategy entails. You'll explore key elements of a robust strategy, including security maturity assessment and recommended steps for safeguarding an organization's assets.

A **security strategy** is an organization’s well-defined plan to protect its digital and physical assets. A comprehensive security strategy consists of the following components.

An IT security team or a specialized cybersecurity consultant is usually responsible for creating an organization’s security strategy. Ideally, this strategy should be in place as soon as an organization forms, but it’s never too late to start, and the sooner, the better! The organization should review and update its security strategy annually, if not more frequently, to ensure that it remains effective and relevant given emerging threats and the organization’s changing objectives and technologies.

# **Security maturity**

An organization’s security strategy is vital to its overall security maturity. **Security maturity** is how well an organization can protect its assets and respond to cybersecurity threats. The more advanced and well-defined an organization’s security protocols and strategies, the greater its maturity level.

Organizations have many security maturity models to choose from when evaluating their maturity. For simplicity’s sake, we’ll focus on one popular model: the **Cybersecurity Capability Maturity Model (C2M2)**. Developed collaboratively by private and public sector organizations, C2M2 is designed to help organizations assess the state of their cybersecurity capabilities. Organizations can use it as a guide to progress from a less mature state, where cybersecurity measures might be reactive or poorly developed, to a more mature state, where measures are proactive, optimized, and well-integrated into the organizational culture.

# **C2M2 scale**

C2M2 uses a scale with four maturity indicator levels (MILs): MIL0, MIL1, MIL2, and MIL3. The levels differ by specific behaviors, practices, and processes relating to cybersecurity. The following table summarizes the characteristics of each maturity indicator level.

| **Level** | **Characteristics** |
| --- | --- |
| **MIL0** | Practices are not performed |
| **MIL1** | Initial practices are performed but might be ad hoc |
| **MIL2** | Management characteristics:
• Practices are documented
• Adequate resources are provided to support the process
Approach characteristic:
• Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL1 |
| **MIL3** | Management characteristics:
• Activities are guided by policies or other organizational directives
• Responsibility, accountability, and authority for performing the practices are assigned
• Personnel performing the practices have adequate skills and knowledge
• The effectiveness of activities is evaluated and tracked
Approach characteristic:
• Practices are more complete or advanced than at MIL2 |

# **Module 3   Prevent attacks**

**Introduction**

An organization’s first area of interest in cybersecurity is to prevent a successful attack from occurring. In this module, you’ll learn some common approaches that organizations can take to prevent attacks.

# **Goal of attack prevention strategies**

A perfect, unbeatable security strategy doesn’t exist. Attackers always develop new techniques to bypass security measures, making current defenses obsolete.

A more realistic and effective security strategy focuses on making successful attacks more difficult to achieve. By doing so, organizations can deter all but the most determined attackers. Imagine that compromising a certain organization’s system would cost an attacker USD 100,000 worth of resources. If the compromised system is worth only USD 80,000 to the attacker, then the attacker is unlikely to attack. Therefore, the defense can work despite its imperfections.

A practical yet effective security strategy often involves layering defenses, updating and patching systems regularly, and investing in threat intelligence to stay ahead of emerging threats. These measures increase the time, cost, and effort required to complete a successful attack, in turn dramatically reducing the likelihood of a breach.

# The goal of cybersecurity is to reduce operational risk to an acceptable level by introducing the correct mixture of education, processes, and technologies.

With this goal in mind, let’s examine some strategies that organizations use to prevent cyberattacks:

- 
    
    Reduce the attack surface
    
- 
    
    Create a demilitarized zone (DMZ)
    
- 
    
    Follow the principle of least privilege
    
- 
    
    Manage software vulnerabilities
    
- 
    
    Use defense in depth
    

# **Reduce the attack surface**

One of the first concepts to consider is attack surface. An **attack surface** is all the points in a system where an attacker can attempt to enter it, impact it, or obtain data. The attack surface includes all points of vulnerability, such as interfaces, protocols, and services.

The larger the attack surface, the greater the risk of infiltration. Therefore, a primary goal of any good security strategy is to keep the attack surface as small as possible. Doing so minimizes vulnerabilities, making the system less attractive and more difficult for attackers to breach.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Consider an organization that has a payment record system. To reduce the system’s attack surface, the organization restricts employees’ system access to several office locations. As a result, its cybersecurity team can ignore external internet traffic at the perimeter, significantly reducing the attack surface for potential attackers. Instead of having countless IP addresses from which to launch an attack, attackers must first compromise a trusted device, and then use it for further attacks. This added layer of complexity increases the challenge for attackers.
    

Organizations keep giving employees more ways to access internal systems. For example, many organizations provide remote access methods and permit employees to access systems from personal devices. These features have helped to improve accessibility, service offerings, and employment flexibility. But they’ve also expanded the attack surface. As a result, establishing a secure perimeter has become more challenging. Organizations must be aware of their perimeter and proactively monitor it.

# **Create a demilitarized zone (DMZ)**

A vital part of secure system design is a demilitarized zone. A **demilitarized zone (DMZ)** is a network segment between an organization’s internal, private network and the internet. It’s a buffer zone that adds an extra layer of safety. To access the internal network, attackers must go through the DMZ. Even if they breach the DMZ, the internal network is still safe.

Typically, DMZs house servers that must be accessible from the wider internet yet still need protection. These servers might include web, email, file transfer protocol (FTP), and DNS servers. These servers contain public data, not sensitive internal data.

![image.png](attachment:c88d0d9a-d2ba-45fa-811b-1be989e90c54:image.png)

This diagram shows a DMZ in action. A legitimate external user can access servers and applications contained in the DMZ, the segment between the external and internal firewalls. But this user cannot access more sensitive servers and applications in the internal network behind the internal firewall. For example, a customer might be able to place orders for a digital payment system or access email. Still, they cannot access employee records or other customers’ financial data on the internal network.

# **Follow the principle of least privilege**

Organizations must decide the appropriate levels of permission for applications and employees. They should do so following the principle of **least privilege**: grant a user or application the fewest permissions needed to complete their function.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    An organization sets up its human resources (HR) database so that managers have read-only access to data for the job roles that they manage. If an attacker steals a certain manager’s credentials, then the attacker can only compromise the confidentiality of those specific records. The attacker cannot modify them because they are read-only. Also, the attacker cannot access applications for other areas of the business.
    

By introducing this control, the organization reduces the consequences of a successful attack compared to one on a less restricted system. And by reducing the consequences, the organization reduces the risk value. You might see the military term *blast radius* applied in this context, in which the radius indicates an attack’s area of effect. Reducing permissions is an effective way to limit the blast radius.

# **Manage software vulnerabilities**

**Software vulnerability management** involves monitoring and mitigating vulnerabilities in software systems. It includes **patch management**, the process of applying patches and updating systems as fixes become available.

When a vendor creates a new version of its software, it might decide to stop supporting the older version. For example, Microsoft no longer supports older versions of Windows, such as Windows 7. As a result, the company no longer releases security patches, making Windows 7 devices easy targets for attackers. When possible, organizations should use software versions that the vendor supports. Otherwise, they should implement **compensating controls** that reduce the risk associated with known vulnerabilities. These controls might include disabling certain features, increasing network security, or increasing monitoring to detect suspicious activity.

Generally, updating software and applications to their latest versions significantly reduces the risk of a successful attack. Still, new versions of software can also introduce vulnerabilities. Organizations must check with vendors to know what and when patches are available. If a vendor has no fix for a vulnerability, organizations can implement temporary compensating controls, such as disabling a feature or reverting to a previous version.

An organization can use a vulnerability scanner to assess what software is vulnerable to a specific attack. A **vulnerability scanner** is an application that scans a system for known vulnerabilities, such as outdated software, missing patches, misconfigured settings, or weak passwords. Some vulnerability scanners are network-based, examining vulnerabilities by active testing. Others scan static source code for possible errors. Both scanners produce valuable information for identifying flaws before an attacker does.

# **Use defense in depth**

![image.png](attachment:2d7f6522-83c1-48a1-903b-01afb4733a13:image.png)

Another key consideration for defense is for organizations to use a layered approach. The term *defense in depth* derives from the military; instead of relying on a single form of defense, you layer them. The meaning is similar in IT. **Defense in depth** is a strategy in which you use multiple layers of controls to protect assets.

For example, an organization might apply the following layers of security:

- 
    
    Network defenses such as firewalls
    
- 
    
    Device defenses such as malware scanners
    
- 
    
    Data defenses such as encryption
    

For an attack to succeed, it must compromise or circumvent all these layers, which is challenging.

# **Module 4  Detect attacks**

**Introduction**

Should an organization’s defenses fail to prevent a cyberattack successfully, the organization’s next priority is to detect the cyberattack. Hopefully, detection happens while the attack is in progress or, even better, before the breach occurs.

# **Antimalware software**

A standard method for attacking a system is malware and a standard measure for detecting malware is antimalware software. **Antimalware software**, or antivirus software, is specialized software that detects, quarantines, and even destroys malware on computers or networks. Some well-known antimalware programs include Malwarebytes, McAfee Antivirus, and Windows Defender Antivirus. You can install this software locally on a single device or run and manage the software on a centralized server.

Antimalware software detects malware by scanning all device files for signatures. A **malware signature** is a pattern of attributes that corresponds to known malware. After identifying a signature in a file, the software deletes the file, quarantines it, or alerts you that the file might be infected.

# **Logging**

One of the most essential methods for attack detection is logging. **Logging** is the process where actions are accurately recorded in a secure location. Log records should be tamper-proof and act as a permanent record of what has occurred within a network. You can perform logging on individual machines or applications.

The types of actions logged depend on the organization’s systems and security needs. Commonly logged actions include user logins and logouts, failed login attempts, system configuration changes, packet traffic, and process or service initiation. Also, logs often record alterations to files or databases.

Though a single log entry might not be highly valuable in isolation, a larger collection helps track activities of legitimate users and malicious actors. These logs provide an audit trail invaluable for diagnosing issues and identifying malicious activity or security breaches.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    The following log entry shows the log format that Apache web servers use:
    
    *9.12.156.2 - bob [11/Jan/2020:14:16:34 -0700] “GET /index.html HTTP/1.0” 200 4066*
    
    Notice that this log entry describes a user named bob who is accessing a specific web page with the status and time noted.
    

# **Network monitoring**

In addition to recording events happening on servers, organizations can monitor communications across their network. This approach, known as **traffic analysis**, can identify network activity, even encrypted activity. Traffic analysis involves tracking different metrics related to the network. Some examples of these metrics include the source and destination of traffic, network protocols used, bandwidth used, and packet size. Advanced traffic analysis can also identify specific applications or services in use, the presence of any malicious code, and unusual behavior or anomalies that might indicate a cyberattack.

Some types of malware pivot from device to device in ways that good network monitoring tools can easily identify.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Imagine a network monitoring tool is in use. If someone uses a network device to stream video, then the tool will show high bandwidth consumption from the device over an extended period. Conversely, if someone uses a network device to download a large file, then the tool will show a high demand peak for the device and then little or nothing after that point.
    

# **Security information and event management (SIEM) tools**

This screen capture shows the interface of a SIEM service called [IBM Security QRadar SIEM(opens in a new tab)](https://www.ibm.com/products/qradar-siem). This network security intelligence and analytics software monitors for threats and insider attacks.

![image.png](attachment:62dc4cc0-937e-46f8-b271-0a2a80b683e4:image.png)

Making sense of all the data collected through network monitoring can be challenging. For help, many cybersecurity professionals turn to security information and event management (SIEM) tools. A **security information and event management (SIEM)** tool collects all the data throughout an organization’s technology infrastructures and aggregates it so the cybersecurity team can identify and analyze events and patterns of potential attacks.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Imagine that a cybersecurity team suspects that an attacker is trying to compromise a user’s account using brute force attacks. They can use a SIEM tool to detect brute force login attempts for that account. To do so, they might set an alert to trigger if five or more failed logins occur per minute for the account. Suppose an attacker attempts to compromise the account by working through millions of username or password combinations. In that case, the attacker will exceed the threshold, triggering the alert in the SIEM tool and notifying the team.
    

# **Security operations center (SOC)**

The group responsible for looking after an organization’s security is often part of the security operations center. A **security operations center (SOC)** is a dedicated team of cybersecurity professionals that uses specialized software to actively monitor, detect, investigate, and respond to an organization’s potential security threats and incidents in real time. One of the SOC’s key objectives is to detect attacks in progress using SIEM and other monitoring tools.

Security analysts in a SOC are responsible for assessing an organization’s security. If they detect an attack or potential attack, they will decide how to respond to it following organizational procedures.

# **False alarms**

One challenge in SOCs is determining the best thresholds for alerts. Their goal is to reduce **false positives**, which are legitimate events incorrectly recorded as malicious.

Confirming if an alert is a false positive is the responsibility of a security analyst. If a specific legitimate event triggers too many false positives, the analyst should consider setting the thresholds higher.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    Consider an employee who returns to work after a long holiday and forgets her password. If she guesses her password incorrectly, then her repeated attempts might exceed the threshold, triggering an alert.
    

# **Artificial intelligence (AI)**

Artificial intelligence (AI) is enhancing organizations’ attack detection and defense. Let’s explore how AI impacts key areas of attack detection.

***Select each section to learn more.***

## **Logging–**

AI automates the process of logging and analyzing large volumes of data from various sources. This manual task would take a human an enormous amount of time, but AI can do it very quickly, enabling real-time threat detection and prevention.

## **Network monitoring–**

AI can analyze traffic patterns and identify anomalies that might indicate an attack. For example, a sudden surge in network traffic might indicate a distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. With AI, organizations can detect such anomalies instantly and initiate appropriate countermeasures.

## **SIEM tools–**

SIEM tools use AI to collate and analyze data across an organization’s network. These tools identify patterns and correlations, helping to identify potential security threats. For example, QRadar SIEM sets alert thresholds for abnormal activities, such as multiple failed login attempts.

## **SOCs–**

In a SOC, AI can help security analysts work more efficiently. Instead of manually sifting through tons of data to identify potentially malicious activity, analysts can focus on responding to the alerts that the AI system generates. AI not only saves analysts time but helps mitigate threats more swiftly.

## **Machine learning (ML)–**

Organizations can train AI systems to distinguish between normal and unusual behavior. The AI trains on historical data that includes legitimate threats and false positives. With the help of machine learning algorithms, the AI system learns to recognize patterns associated with false positives.

For example, the system might determine that a certain number of failed login attempts from a trusted internal IP address during working hours is a common pattern of a forgotten password, not a malicious action. Therefore, the system learns not to trigger an alert in this situation. Over time, it can become better at reducing false positives, thereby fine-tuning the thresholds and alert sensitivity. It can even reduce the time spent on false positives by automating the verification process.

# **Module 5  Respond to attacks**

**Introduction**

Even the best defenses can’t prevent and detect all attacks. All organizations must respond to a cyberattack at some point. A vital part of security planning is preparing for an incident and establishing plans for what to do when one occurs.

In this module, you’ll explore the basic concepts of incident response.

# **Incident response**

The [SANS Institute(opens in a new tab)](https://www.sans.org/) provides many educational courses, events, and online resources relating to cybersecurity, including an industry-standard framework for incident response. Let’s briefly review the six phases of this framework.

- 
    
    **Phase 1: Preparation**
    
    In the first phase, preparation, an organization starts planning what it will do when an incident occurs. Typical steps include preparing resources and testing procedures.
    
- 
    
    **Phase 2: Identification**
    
    In the second phase, identification, the security team detects the security event. Then, the team initiates the incident response protocol to investigate further and confirms that the event is an actual security incident, not a false alarm.
    
- 
    
    **Phase 3: Containment**
    
    In the third phase, containment, the security team works to prevent the situation from worsening. Typical steps include segregating networks and shutting down access routes or certain systems.
    
- 
    
    **Phase 4: Eradication**
    
    In the fourth phase, eradication, the security team works to completely remove the presence and impact of the malware or attackers. For example, the team might wipe devices or restore them to safe states. Incomplete eradication often results in malware re-emerging, so eradication efforts must be thorough.
    
- 
    
    **Phase 5: Recovery**
    
    In the fifth phase, recovery, the organization returns to standard operation. Typical steps include removing temporary fixes and restoring certain services.
    
- 
    
    **Phase 6: Reflection**
    
    In the sixth phase, reflection, the security team and relevant parties reflect on the incident’s cause and the response’s effectiveness. Some incident response frameworks referred to this phase as the lessons learned phase. However, the lessons *identified* phase might be a better title if the organization makes no changes!
    

# **Module 6 Introducing cryptography**

**Introduction**

In this module, you’ll discover the mathematical field of cryptography. Cryptography is fundamental to vital concepts in information security, and all cybersecurity professionals should understand it to be successful.

For the definition of cryptography, let’s turn to the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST).

Cryptography is the principles, means, and methods of transforming data to conceal its content, prevent its unauthorized use, or prevent its undetected modification.

– [National Institute of Standards and Technology(opens in a new tab)](https://csrc.nist.gov/glossary/term/cryptography)

You’ve learned that one key objective of cybersecurity is keeping data **confidential**. Keeping and sharing secrets has been challenging for thousands of years. Though methods for preserving confidentiality have changed significantly across the years, the objective has remained broadly the same.

# **Encryption**

A standard method for preserving a message’s confidentiality is encryption. **Encryption** is the process of converting a message into something understandable only to those with a decryption key to reverse the process. A message converted into an unreadable state is **encrypted**.

When you encrypt data, you use a cipher. A **cipher** is a set of transformations that converts **plaintext**, the intelligible, human-readable data, into **ciphertext**, the data’s encrypted form. To convert plaintext, the cipher follows a **key**, which is a blueprint for which transformations to make.

At a high level, modern-day encryption comes in two forms: symmetric and asymmetric.

# **Symmetric encryption**

In **symmetric encryption**, the algorithm for encrypting information uses the same key as the decryption process. Symmetric encryption is fast and easy to implement. It relies on both the sender and receiver having access to the same key, similar to a password or shared secret, to maintain a private information link.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    A simple example is a rotation-based cipher in which characters are increased or decreased by a fixed number of places in the alphabet. The number of places to move forward and backward acts as the key. If the sender uses a key of +1, they rotate characters forwards by 1, and then the receiver uses a -1 rotation to receive the original message.
    
    In the following cipher, the word *HOLIDAY* is encrypted by a +1 shift in the alphabet to be *IPMJEBZ*.
    
    ![image.png](attachment:583101a4-6d19-490a-85de-176d5297f210:image.png)
    

The **Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)** is a commonly used algorithm for symmetric encryption. It uses a secret key to transform plaintext into ciphertext. Only those with the correct key can decrypt the ciphertext. Organizations use AES to protect sensitive data such as passwords and financial transactions.

# **Asymmetric encryption**

In **asymmetric encryption**, also known as public key encryption, you use one key to encrypt data and a different key to decrypt it. These keys are known as **public keys** and **private keys**, and you generate them simultaneously. You can share your public key with others. Anyone with a copy of this key can use it to encrypt a message before sending it to you. But decrypting that message requires using your private key, which you should keep secret.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    In the following diagram, Alice is the sender, and Bob is the receiver. It represents the transmission process.
    
    1. Alice encrypts a message by using Bob’s public key. Once the message is encrypted, it can only be decrypted using Bob’s private key.
    2. Alice sends the encrypted message to Bob.
    3. Bob decrypts the message by using his private key.
    4. Finally, Bob can read the message.
    
    Bob must not share his private key with anyone. Otherwise, they would be able to read all his incoming messages.
    
    ![image.png](attachment:65604ea7-6acf-4df6-9e13-0295253aee48:image.png)
    

The main benefit of asymmetric encryption is that organizations can communicate securely with an entity with which they have not previously exchanged a key. In addition, this type of encryption helps ensure that a message goes to the correct receiver.

- 
    
    **Example**
    
    One benefit of asymmetric cryptography comes from online shopping. You can buy goods from shops without physically going to the location to create a shared, unique, symmetric key.
    
    If symmetric cryptography were the only option, the agreed symmetric key would be required to encrypt and decrypt all future transactions between you and the shop.
    
    In contrast, using asymmetric cryptography is convenient and saves time because you don’t need to meet in person. Without this benefit, secure online shopping is practically impossible.
    

# **Quantum encryption**

Present-day computers lack the power and stability to crack modern encryption technologies. But quantum computing might be able to do so soon.

**Quantum computing** is a rapidly emerging technology that harnesses the laws of quantum mechanics to solve problems too complex for classical computers.

– [What is quantum computing?(opens in a new tab)](https://www.ibm.com/topics/quantum-computing) *IBM*

Quantum computing processes information using quantum mechanics. As a result, it can perform complex calculations much faster than traditional computing methods.
