## 2. The CIA Triad: Core Objectives üéØ

The three fundamental objectives of cybersecurity are **Confidentiality**, **Integrity**, and **Availability**.

### 2.1 Confidentiality

**Confidentiality** means keeping data secret, accessible only to authorized people.
* **Example**: A software company keeps its source code confidential, limiting access to only necessary employees. Healthcare providers must keep patient data private.

### 2.2 Integrity

**Integrity** ensures data is trustworthy and accurate by protecting it from unauthorized modification or destruction.
* **Example**: A financial transaction is altered from $10 to $10,000. Compromised integrity can be intentional or unintentional.

### 2.3 Availability

**Availability** ensures timely and reliable access to and use of data.
* **Example**: You expect 24/7 online access to your bank account. An online retailer must ensure its website has constant uptime to prevent loss of business.

## 3. Cybersecurity Controls üõ°Ô∏è

**Controls** are safeguards or countermeasures used to avoid, detect, or minimize security risks.

### 3.1 Controls for Confidentiality
* **Encryption**: Converts data into an unreadable form unless you have the decryption key.
* **Access Controls**: Measures like passwords and biometrics that restrict who can view or modify data.
* **Patch Management**: Updating system software to fix security vulnerabilities.

### 3.2 Controls for Integrity
* **Checksums**: Mathematical algorithms that generate a unique value for a data set. A change in the data changes the checksum.
* **Access Controls** and **User Permissions**: Limit who can change data.
* **Data Backups**: Help restore data to a correct state if it's altered.
* **Audit Trails**: Track and record all changes made to data.

### 3.3 Controls for Availability
* **Redundant Systems** and **Data Backup**: Protect against data loss and system failure by using multiple servers or storing data in multiple locations.
* **Antimalware Software** and **Firewalls**: Protect systems from attacks that could disrupt services.

## 4. Key Elements of a Cybersecurity Strategy üß†

Effective cybersecurity relies on three key elements: **Education**, **Process**, and **Technology**.

### 4.1 Education
Education and awareness are crucial for building a **human firewall**. Regular training reduces risky behavior and encourages employees to report suspicious activity.

### 4.2 Process
Defined, clear, and consistent processes guide users and activities, making it easier to maintain security. Overly complex processes can frustrate users and be exploited by attackers.

### 4.3 Technology
This includes the underlying infrastructure and controls like device encryption and network defenses. Good technology solves problems without creating new ones for users.

---

## 5. Risk Management üìä

**Risk** is the possibility of something happening with a negative consequence. Understanding and managing risk is a core function of cybersecurity.

### 5.1 Risk Valuation
You can calculate the significance of a risk with the following equation:

$$Risk Value = Consequence \times Likelihood$$

* **Consequence**: The impact and associated damages.
* **Likelihood**: How often the risk occurs.

In cybersecurity, likelihood is further broken down:

$$Likelihood = Adversary Capability \times Adversary Motivation \times Vulnerability Severity$$

### 5.2 Responses to Risk
Organizations can choose one of four responses to a risk:
* **Acceptance**: Acknowledging the risk and being prepared to deal with its consequences.
* **Reduction**: Taking steps to lower the risk's likelihood or consequence by implementing controls.
* **Transference**: Shifting the risk to a third party, typically through insurance or outsourcing.
* **Rejection**: Withdrawing from the activity or market that causes the risk.

### 5.3 Risk Appetite
An organization's **risk appetite** is the level of risk it's willing to accept. This should align with its strategic goals. A high risk appetite might involve using new technologies for competitive advantage, while a low risk appetite prioritizes stability and protective measures.

* **Extortion**: Gaining control of a victim's systems and demanding a ransom, most notably with **ransomware**.

### 11.1 Cryptocurrency
Cybercriminals prefer **cryptocurrency** (like Bitcoin) because it is **decentralized** and often **anonymous**, making transactions difficult for law enforcement to trace. It's the primary currency of the dark web.

---

## 12. Social Engineering ü•∏

**Social engineering** is the use of deception to manipulate individuals into making security mistakes. It exploits human psychology rather than technical vulnerabilities.

### 12.1 Key Elements
* **Well-Researched**: Attackers build credibility by using company letterheads, jargon, etc.
* **Delivered Confidently**: Attackers build rapport with their targets over time.
* **Plausible and Realistic**: The best attacks make the victim unaware they've been tricked.

### 12.2 Phishing Red Flags
Be wary of emails that:
* You weren't expecting.
* Use a generic greeting.
* Have poor grammar or spelling errors.
* Ask for personal or financial information.
* Create a sense of urgency.
* Have suspicious URLs.

---

## 13. Open-Source Intelligence (OSINT) üïµÔ∏è

**Open-source intelligence (OSINT)** is data collected from publicly available sources like blogs, news sites, and social media.

* **Benefits**: It's often free, easy to acquire, and **undetectable** to the target.
* **Use in Attacks**: Attackers use OSINT during the reconnaissance phase to gather information about a target before launching a more complex attack.

---

## 14. Technical Scanning üñ•Ô∏è

---

## 17. Preventing Attacks üõë

Since a perfect defense doesn't exist, the goal is to make attacks more difficult and costly.

* **Reduce the Attack Surface**: Minimize the points where an attacker can try to enter a system.
* **Create a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ)**: A buffer network between an organization's private network and the internet. 
* **Principle of Least Privilege**: Grant users the minimum permissions they need to do their job. This reduces the **blast radius** of a successful attack.
* **Manage Software Vulnerabilities**: Regularly update software and apply patches. Use **vulnerability scanners** to identify weaknesses.
* **Defense in Depth**: Use multiple layers of security controls, such as firewalls, antimalware, and encryption. 

---

## 18. Detecting Attacks üîç

If prevention fails, the next priority is detection.

* **Antimalware Software**: Detects malware by scanning files for known signatures.
* **Logging**: Records actions in a secure, tamper-proof location to provide an audit trail.
* **Network Monitoring**: Analyzes network traffic to identify unusual behavior.
* **Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)**: Tools that collect and aggregate data from across the infrastructure to help analysts identify potential attacks.
* **Security Operations Center (SOC)**: A dedicated team that uses specialized software to actively monitor and respond to threats in real-time.
* **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Enhances detection by automating logging, analyzing network patterns, and reducing **false positives** by learning to distinguish between normal and malicious activity.

---

## 19. Responding to Attacks üö®

Organizations must have a plan for when an attack occurs. The SANS Institute outlines a six-phase incident response framework:
1.  **Preparation**: Planning and testing procedures.
2.  **Identification**: Detecting a security event and confirming it's an incident.
3.  **Containment**: Preventing the attack from spreading (e.g., segregating networks).
4.  **Eradication**: Completely removing the malware or attacker from the system.
5.  **Recovery**: Restoring services and returning to normal operations.
6.  **Reflection**: Reviewing the incident to learn from it and improve future responses.
